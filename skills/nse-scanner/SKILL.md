  Chart Scanner. Scans thousands of charts for setups: opening-range
  breakouts, flags, oversold bounces on NSE. Builds the list of NSE stocks in
  the EQ series (the ones you can day trade) from NSE's EQUITY_L.csv,
  runs a pre-market scan of daily closes (20-day closing-high breakout, bull
  flag, reclaimed the 20-day average, oversold, oversold bounce) and an
  intraday opening-range breakout scan on 5-minute bars, then writes
  trader/watchlist.json for nse-news and nse-entry. Free Yahoo data,
  bar by bar. Use when the user says "scan the market", "find me setups",
  "what is breaking out", "opening range breakouts", "scan for bull flags",
  "oversold stocks", "pre-market scan", "build my watchlist", "what should I
  look at today", or at the start of a trading day before /nse-news.

# nse-scanner

The Chart Scanner is the first step of a day trade. It reads thousands of
free charts and lists the ones that match a rule. That is all it does. A scan
is a list of charts that match a rule, not a list of stocks to buy, and a
setup on a chart is not a prediction. Most people who day trade lose money;
the scanner does not change that. It only saves you from flipping through
5,000 charts by hand.

`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` below is this skill's folder (where this SKILL.md lives).

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scan.py" universe                       # -> trader/universe.txt
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scan.py" daily                          # before the open -> trader/watchlist.json
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scan.py" daily --symbols RELIANCE,TCS,INFY  # or --watchlist FILE, --limit 200
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scan.py" orb                            # after 9:35 AM IST -> trader/watchlist.json
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scan.py" orb --at 10:00                 # cut the clock at 10:00 AM IST
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scan.py" orb --watchlist trader/watchlist.json --json
```

Flags: `--min-price 5` and `--min-volume` (daily 1,000,000, orb 0),
`--or-minutes 15`, `--max-confirm 200` (orb stage 2),
`--now "2026-10-19 10:00"` (IST) to pin the clock, `--offline PATH`
to read saved Yahoo files, `--no-write`, `--show N`, `--json`. Exit code 0
when the scan found something, 1 when it found nothing or could not run (the
reason is one plain line).

## What it reads and writes

| file | what |
| --- | --- |
| `trader/universe.txt` | written by `universe`: one `SYMBOL\|Name` a line, read by `daily` and `orb` |
| `trader/watchlist.json` | written by `daily` and `orb`: `mode`, `as_of`, `universe`, `scanned`, `failed`, `hits[]`. nse-news and nse-entry read `hits[].symbol` |
| `trader/config.json` | read by `orb`: `no_entries_after` (default 14:45) |

## The universe

`universe` downloads NSE's list of listed equities,
`https://nsearchives.nseindia.com/content/equities/EQUITY_L.csv`, and keeps
the rows in the **EQ** series: rolling settlement, so they can be bought and
sold the same day. BE and BZ (trade-for-trade) stocks are dropped because
every trade in them must be delivered, so they cannot be day traded. NSE
symbols are kept as NSE writes them (`M&M`, `BAJAJ-AUTO`); the tools add `.NS`
when they ask Yahoo for charts. If NSE's site refuses the download, save the
CSV from a browser and run `scan.py universe --offline <folder>`.

The full EQ list is about 2,000 names, many of them thin. For day trading,
most people scan a shorter list: the Nifty 50, Nifty 100 or the F&O stocks
(liquid, tight spreads). Put those in a watchlist and use `--watchlist` or
`--symbols`.

## The daily scan (before the open)

Yahoo's spark endpoint returns closes for 20 symbols a request, so 2,000
symbols take about 100 requests with the polite pause (0.3 s). Liquidity comes from the spark meta: last price at
least `--min-price` and last session's volume at least `--min-volume`. Run it
before the open or after the close: during the session the volume is the
day's so far, and today's daily bar is left out until 3:30 PM.

The setups are computed from daily closes only (spark has no highs or lows),
so they use closes, not highs and lows:

| setup | the rule on closes |
| --- | --- |
| `breakout_20d` | the last close is above every close of the 20 sessions before it |
| `bull_flag` | up more than 10 % over the 10 sessions before the last 5, then the last 5 closes inside a 5 % range |
| `reclaim_ma20` | the close before was under its 20-day average, the last close is above it |
| `oversold` | RSI 14 (Wilder) under 30 |
| `oversold_bounce` | RSI 14 was under 30 yesterday and today closed up |

A closing-high breakout fires more often than an intraday-high one (ITC on
Oct 16 broke its 20-day closing high, not its 20-day intraday high). Hits are
listed most traded first (price times volume).

## The opening-range breakout scan (during the session)

The opening range is the first `--or-minutes` (15) of the session: the 9:30,
9:35 and 9:40 five-minute bars. A hit is the first completed 5-minute bar
to CLOSE above the range high, at that bar's close time.

1. Stage 1, every symbol: spark closes of today's 5-minute bars, 20 a
   request. A chart goes on only if a completed bar after the range closed at
   or above the highest close of the range. That is a necessary condition
   (the range high is at least every range close), so no breakout is lost.
2. Stage 2, each candidate: the v8 chart with real highs and lows, one
   request each. Range high = the highest high of the range bars, range low =
   the lowest low. On a strong morning most charts are candidates, so stage 2
   checks at most `--max-confirm` (200) of them, the most traded first (price
   times volume so far), and prints PARTIAL with the count it skipped.
   `--max-confirm 0` checks them all.

Timing: each spark request covers 20 names and each stage-2 chart is one
request, with a polite pause between them. A list of 50 to 100 liquid names
takes well under a minute; the whole EQ list takes a few minutes. For a fast
answer, scan the daily watchlist or the names you trade (`--watchlist`, `--symbols`).

A chart is usable only when every 5-minute bar from 9:15 to the cutoff is
there; a missing bar means a halt or a thin stock. Null closes are dropped,
a bar off the 5-minute grid (the live tick, like 10:58:07) is dropped, and a
bar counts only once it is complete (start + 5 minutes). Before 9:35 AM IST, on a
weekend or holiday, after the close, or after `no_entries_after` (an expired
setup) it prints one plain line and writes nothing.

## Data and limits

- Yahoo's chart and spark endpoints are free, unofficial and can lag. Bars are
  5-minute bars, bar by bar, never tick by tick. query2 first, query1 on a 429
  or 5xx, one retry after a 5-second wait on a 429.
- Partial results are said as partial: "Fetched 4,980 of 5,259 charts (279
  failed or had no data)". Never round a partial scan up to "the whole market".
- NSE trading holidays for 2026 are built in (NSE's list, read 2026-10-25). The 2027 list is
  not out yet: on a 2027 date the tools say so; add the year when NSE publishes it.
- Floors: `--min-price 50` (₹50) and `--min-volume 500000` for `daily`.

## Steps

1. Once a week or so: `scan.py universe`.
2. Before the open: `scan.py daily`. Tell the user the counts (fetched,
   liquid, scanned, hits) and the top few by setup.
3. After 9:35 AM IST (10:00 is the classic): `scan.py orb`. Tell the user how
   many usable charts broke their range and when, and that a later hit is
   closer to the price now.
4. The user picks one chart. Hand it on: `/nse-news TICKER` (what is moving
   it), then `/nse-entry TICKER` (the entry bar by bar). Never pick for them.

## Example

`scan.py orb --symbols RELIANCE,TCS,INFY,HDFCBANK,ICICIBANK --now "2026-10-26 10:00"`
after the open lists the charts whose first completed 5-minute bar after the
9:15 to 9:30 range closed above the range high, with the time and how far
over. The user picks one chart, Claude hands it to `/nse-news` and then
`/nse-entry`. The tests run the same rule on a synthetic DEMO day
(`tests/fixtures/nse`): range 1417.88 to 1448.72, the 9:55 bar closed at
1456.70, 0.55 % over, at 10:00 AM.

## Rules

- Say what was scanned: how many symbols, how many charts came back, how many
  were usable, and the time of the data.
- Say "matched a rule", never "a buy", "a winner" or "a good trade".
- Never print a P&L, a return or a profit figure.
- A hit is stale once the price has moved on. Re-run before acting on it.

## What it never does

It never places, sizes or checks an order, never says which stock to buy,
never calls data real time, and never promises that a setup works.

## Safety

- Education and tooling, not investment advice; this pack is not a SEBI-registered adviser. A PASS is a rules check, not a recommendation.
- Paper trading by default (`"paper": true`). Going live is the user's own decision, in their own config.
- Nothing in this pack places an order except nse-broker, and only when all three hold: nse-risk
  passed that exact order today, the user typed an explicit yes for that one order in the chat, and the
  user clicked Allow once on Claude's own card because the order tool is set to "Needs approval"
  (Customize > Connectors > tool permissions). Never set an order tool to "Always allow".
- No options, margin, short selling or leverage unless the config allows it and the user confirms.
- Broker keys live in environment variables or the Claude Desktop config, never in the chat.
